# mtrack

This is a tracking program.

Use `mtrack` with no arguments or with the `-h` argument to find the help menu.

To make a log, write `tracker xxx message`, and it will record it in a `~/.config/tracker/log.txt` file.
 - The `xxx` can be any list of 0-3 characters to represent up or down changes in mood.
 - The `message` should be a message explaining the change.
